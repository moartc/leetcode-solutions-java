    /*
    So return the index of the gas station from which I can start and travel endlessly

    It seems that for each gas station I could calculate a difference between the cost of getting there from the previous
    gas station and amount of gas I can tank there.
    If the sum of these differences is negative, the answer is -1
    also, I can start only at these gas stations where the cost is lower than the amount of gas.

    update:
    I checked the solution on neetcode, since I couldnâ€™t find it in a reasonable time.

    last comment: the first solution found after reaching the end of the array is our answer.
    If there's something else and it's negative, it can't be a new solution. If it's positive - it only adds to our previous starting point.
